This is a personal website made using [Next.js](https://next.js.org).

## Getting Started

To run locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or to run the development server:
npm run dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can modify my website by making changes to `index.js` in `pages`.
(If running in the development server the page will auto-update as you made edits.)

## Deploy on Github Pages

This site is deployed on github pages, to do so yourself you can configure your repository
for this using [these steps](https://pages.github.com/).

Next, make sure to utilize `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` for the correct Github Actions necessary to deploy.

Finally, push and this should deploy your site.
